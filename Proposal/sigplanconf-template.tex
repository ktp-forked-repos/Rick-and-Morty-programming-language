\begin{abstract}
This project attempts to create an esoteric programming language
deigned based on the popular cartoon, Rick and Morty. This programing
language will make use of integrated Linear Temporal logic to ensure
correctness, and advanced multithreading. In addition, this language
is intended to be interseting enough to attract students and
programmers unfamiliar with these concepts under the veneer of an
interesting language and thus introduce possibly non acadmemically oriented students
 to the concepts of temporal logic, and multithreading.

\section{Introduction}
The popular TV show Rick and Morty often uses the concepts of
Parallel timlines and alternative universes as a main theme in may
episodes. Given the popularity of the show and its relevence in pop
culture, it was decided that it would be a interesting medium over
which to introduce the concepts of multithreading, and temporal logic.
This language will include many refrences to the show in the syntax,
and thus be attractive to fan of the show, and also make the use of
temporal logic more whimsical.

Our final goal is to create a turing complete language which satisfies
the above conditions of refrence, and also makes serious of the
concepts of linear temporal programming.

\section{Prior Work}

Linear Temporal Logic:


Principles of languages design:
Language design is a field which has had a lot of focus directed
towards it. Language features have been divided up into features that
deal with Reading, writing, running and reasoning, and have 

There are also currently hundreds of esoteric languages that
have been created that 



\section{Proposed Work}
Temporal logic can be an extremely useful concept in various computing problems, particularly related to program verification. In order to ensure, for example, that a certain state is eventually reached, we need temporal logic. Similarly, we can use temporal logic to ensure that certain eventualities are never reached. A final important application is to ensure "fairness" in multi-threaded systems. A program may, for example, want to ensure that if a process makes a certain request often enough, that request is eventually fulfilled.

Thus, we propose to use Haskell to develop a simple Turing-complete computer language featuring temporal logic and some simple multi-threading utilities. Without multi-threading, we cannot use the temporal logic capabilities to their full potential. GHC already supports implicit parallelism. Thus, we can simply use GHC's implementation as the foundation of our multi-threading capabilities. 

Our language will also support various temporal logic statements. This will allow programmers to properly verify non-terminating applications. 
\section{Timeline}
\begin{enumerate}
\item    Friday 11/4: project checkpoint 1 due:

  By Friday 11/4, we intend to have a basic Turing complete language
  with many of the jokes and refrences of Rick and Morty Implemented.

\item  Friday 11/18: project checkpoint 2 due:

By Friday 11/18 we intend to have implemented singly threaded
temporally logical system integrated into the language. This will be 
reminicent of Haskells lazy execution due to it's singly threaded nature.

\item  Friday 12/2: project checkpoint 3 due:
  
  By Friday 12/2 we intend to have easily implemented a system which
  allows the user to simply handle multithreading, and serial execution.

\item  Monday 12/5 and Wednesday 12/7: project presentations:

By this point, we intend to have finished the project, and mostly be
cleaning and them presenting to our peers.

\item Friday 12/9: final project deliverables due:

By this point, we will have the basic all implemented, or at least
some versions of all of them. We may have remaining features that we
were unable to implement due to the scope of the project, but complete
basics implementation will be done.
